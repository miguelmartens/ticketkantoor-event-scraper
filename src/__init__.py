"""
This is the __init__.py file for the src package.

Including this file turns the src directory into a Python package,
allowing its modules to be imported in other parts of the application.

You can also use this file to perform package-level initialization,
such as logging setup (if not done elsewhere), package exports,
and running any initialization code that's appropriate for the package.
"""

# If needed, you can initialize package-level variables, constants, or perform necessary setups here.
# For example, package-wide logging configuration, if not done in a separate module, can go here.

# Example of package-level variable (change as per your needs):
# PACKAGE_CONSTANT = 42

# Import key classes or functions from modules if you want to provide them at the package level
# from .module_name import ClassName, function_name

# __all__ can be used to define what symbols the package exposes to the outside world
# __all__ = ['ClassName', 'function_name']
